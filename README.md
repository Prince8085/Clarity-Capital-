## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports ES Modules (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A valid Google Gemini API key.

### Configuration: The API Key

This project requires a Google Gemini API key to function.

1.  **Get your API Key**: Obtain your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

2.  **Set the API Key**:
    - Open the file: `services/geminiService.ts`
    - Find the following line at the top of the file:
      ```typescript
      const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;
      ```
    - **Replace `process.env.API_KEY`** with your actual API key string:
      ```typescript
      // BEFORE
      // const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;

      // AFTER
      const API_KEY = "YOUR_SECRET_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";
      ```
    - Save the file. **Do not commit this change to a public repository.**

### Running the Application

Because this project uses a modern, bundler-less setup, you don't need to run `npm install` or `npm start`. You simply need a local web server to serve the files.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/clarity-capital.git
    cd clarity-capital
    ```

2.  **Start a local server:**
    If you have Python installed, you can easily start a server:
    ```sh
    # For Python 3
    python -m http.server

    # For Python 2
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use the VS Code "Live Server" extension or any other local server tool.

3.  **Open in browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port your server is running on) in your web browser. The application should now be running.
